Ideal mini script to run as soon as you install Kali Linux. It is in BETA phase, improvements to the code and new tools will be added.

This tool will be very useful when we install Kali Linux and want to automate tasks such as updating the system and repositories, downloading useful packages for everyday use as a normal user, and also downloading useful tools for penetration testing that are not included in Kali Linux.

## How do you run the tool?

First of all, we need to give it execution permissions by using the following command in the terminal:

```
    ┌──(rubelmo㉿Rubelmo)-[~]
    └─$ chmod +x KaliBasic-Tools.sh
```

After giving it execution permissions, we need to run it as root using the following command:

```
    ┌──(rubelmo㉿Rubelmo)-[~]
    └─$ sudo ./KaliBasic-Tools.sh
```
