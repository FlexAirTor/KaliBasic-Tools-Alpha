<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Developed%20on-kali%20linux-blueviolet"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Shell-Bash-blue">

Ideal mini script to run as soon as you install Kali Linux. It is in BETA phase, improvements to the code and new tools will be added.

This tool will be very useful when we install Kali Linux and want to automate tasks such as updating the system and repositories, downloading useful packages for everyday use as a normal user, and also downloading useful tools for penetration testing that are not included in Kali Linux.

## How do you run the tool?

First: we will go to the folder where the README will be located along with the script

```
    ┌──(rubelmo㉿Rubelmo)-[~]
    └─$ cd KaliBasic-Tools-Alpha
```

Second: we must give it execution permissions, we would give this in our console:

```
    ┌──(rubelmo㉿Rubelmo)-[~]
    └─$ chmod +x KaliBasic-Tools.sh
```

After giving it execution permissions, we need to run it as root using the following command:

```
    ┌──(rubelmo㉿Rubelmo)-[~]
    └─$ sudo ./KaliBasic-Tools.sh
```
